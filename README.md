# Unclosed Paragraph Tag Bug in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  While browsers often handle this gracefully, it can lead to inconsistencies in rendering and unexpected behavior, particularly in complex layouts or when using CSS.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of meticulously closing all tags in your HTML documents for clean, predictable results.
